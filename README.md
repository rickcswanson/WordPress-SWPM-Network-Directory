# WordPress-SWPM-Network-Directory
A membership directory that pulls all members created by the Simple Membership Plugin across all subdomains in a multisite network and displays them in a list including their attributes.

The directory features a list compiling all members, a search bar, a fitler for member account status, a fitler for employee status, and a CSV download feature that exports the visible, filtered, or searched members into a CSV file.
